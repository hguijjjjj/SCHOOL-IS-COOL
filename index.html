                <h6 class="text-warning">THE LEISURE LEARNING PLUNGE : THE SUMMER OF '22 
                    The Summer Camp, The Summer of '22, was organised by Sarala Birla Gyan Jyoti, Guwahati, from 1st July to 4th July. The fun filled summer camp for the children was a delightful treat. It gave them an opportunity to imbibe new skills, while making new friends and creating memories. More than 500 exuberant learners from classes IV to IX zealously participated and showcased their diligence towards each planned activity of their choice. 
                    This Summer of '22 aimed at keeping the students engaged and provided them an even platform to explore and express their creativity, in any form. They were able to face their fears, try new things, pushed their boundaries and realised self-sufficiency. 
                    The Summer Camp was inaugurated by the Principal, Dr Diganta Halder on 1st July 2022, Friday amidst enthusiasm and fanfare. The programme coordinators, Mrs Seema Shah and Mrs Panchali Goswami planned a wide variety of specialised activities  and ensured that every activity had a learning curve. 
                    An impressive colourful cultural show by the students marked the closing ceremony of the Summer of '22, in which parents were also invited to take a glimpse of the learnt activities of their kids. The students also showcased their learning aptitude through an exhibition. The  Principal,  Dr. Diganta Halder applauded the efforts of the students and encouraged them to trudge the distinct ways to develop their talents for their holistic growth in the future ahead. 
                    The essence of this camp was to develop a sound character of each student and ultimately the motto was achieved. 
                    This Summer Camp was earnestly appreciated not only by the participants but also by their parents. The overwhelming acknowledgement was a motivating factor for the entire Sarala Birla Gyan Jyoti family.
